### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Cassidy, but you may know me by my pen name, Cass Aleatory. I live in Wisconsin, United States. My professional interests include writing (fiction and non-fiction), game development, and web development. While telling stories is my specialty, I do have some experience as a programmer; I've coded in C#, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and Processing (Java based). I'm also trying to learn more about other roles in the game dev world, including music composition, sound design, graphics art, community management, and user experience design.

I graduated from Verona Area High School in the spring of 2017 and enrolled at UW-Whitewater that same fall. During my undergraduate career, I participated in the Research Apprenticeship Program and earned certificates in Women's & Gender Studies and LGBTQ+ studies. I graduated through the University Honors Program in spring of 2022, walking away with two Bachelor's degrees: a B.S. in Media Arts & Game Development: Technology and a B.A. in Film Studies and Professional Writing & Publishing. I spent most of the next few years embroiled in a variety of extended mental health challenges. I ultimately started my journey in the professional world as a contracted grant writer.

Nowadays, I still write grants as my day job. When I have energy to spare, I work mostly on projects that have personal significance to me. My stories tend to be character-based narratives that deal with themes of emotional and mental struggle, and how love, friendship, and communication are affected by the things that go on inside people's heads. If you'd like to see my portfolio, please visit my personal website. It's hosted through Github Pages, so its repo should be right here on my profile. It's still a little scuffed, but I'll be transforming it into something more professional soon (TM).


### My Active Projects

My main web development project is currently "**You Matter To Me**," a mental health website I've been working on for a few years now. It's a Github Pages site, so you should be able to find it in my starred repos if you're curious to see it. As it nears completion, I'm also starting to consider a restructuring of my personal portfolio website.

My main narrative project is currently **ESCAPE**, a text-based "choose your own adventure" game that I wrote back at Whitewater. There was never anything groundbreaking about it, but I still have some old ideas that I never got around to implementing. I'm currently working with a friend to give ESCAPE a better finale, something that better expresses how much working on the game meant to me all those years ago. My goal is to have the update out by Q4 of 2025, but I won't hesitate to push the timetable back for quality's sake. The original version of ESCAPE is still up on my itch.io pageâ€”there's a link on my website. However, you'd probably be better off waiting for the update; both sadie and I agree that the current version is extremely underwhelming compared to what we have in the works right now.


### Contact Me

My website has links to my email and LinkedIn, which is the only social media I still use. Should any of the below apply to you, feel free to reach out!

**If you have a professional inquiry:** I'm still trying to find my footing amidst some difficult life circumstances, but the world isn't gonna stop and wait. I'll always be open to working on meaningful projects, whether new or old.

**If you knew me at VAHS or Whitewater:** First off, I'm so sorry. But seriously, if I was your peer, student, classmate, etc. in the past, and you'd like to reconnect, please do reach outâ€”I'll be happy to hear from you. (:

**If you have questions about the industry:** I'll help if I can. That said, I don't have the sort of industry job or high-powered connections that would qualify me as a reliable source of professional insight.

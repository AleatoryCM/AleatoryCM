### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Cass Aleatory, but you might also know me as Cassie Shogun, the handle I use across all my social media platforms. I live in Wisconsin, United States and use she/her. I'm an independent game developer and writer. While telling stories is my specialty, I'm also a pretty experienced programmer who's worked in C#, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and Processing (Java based). In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with other game development roles such as music composition, sound design, graphics art, community management, and user experience design.

I graduated from Verona Area High School in the spring of 2017, and then from UW-Whitewater in the spring of 2022. At the latter, I earned two Bachelor's degrees: a B.S. in Media Arts & Game Development: Technology and a B.A. in Film Studies and Professional Writing & Publishing. I also graduated from the University Honors Program there and earned certificates in Women's & Gender Studies and LGBTQ+ studies.

Nowadays, I work mostly on projects of my own choosing that have personal significance to me. My stories tend to be character-based narratives that deal with themes of emotional and mental struggle, and how love, friendship, and communication are affected by the things that go on inside people's heads. I also enjoy writing metagame, LGBTQ+, and (occasionally) nonlinear elements into my stories.

I'm currently taking some informal downtime for mental health. My next project will probably be a comprehensive expansion for ESCAPE (my text-based "choose your own adventure" story). Even though I'm not really doing anything right now, I'm always keeping my eyes open for projects that offer me the chance to tell cool stories. If you want to see ESCAPE and my other work (or if you'd like to hire/work with me!), visit my linktree at https://linktr.ee/CassAleatory! From there, you can access my portfolio, my LinkedIn, and several available channels of contact.
